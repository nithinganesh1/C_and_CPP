C is a general-purpose programming language used to develop a wide variety of software applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, and graphical user interfaces.

I use Linux for developing and running C programs because it is easy, free, and open-source.

I use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to compile C programs.

To compile a C program with GCC, use the following command:

gcc -o executable_file.out source_file.c
This will create an executable file named executable_file.out from the source code in the file source_file.c.

To execute the compiled program
./executable_file.out

Note: The .out extension is not required, but it is a common convention for executable files in Linux.
